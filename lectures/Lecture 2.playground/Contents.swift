//: ## Functions and Closures
//:
//: Use `func` to declare a function. Call a function by following its name with a list of arguments in parentheses. Use `->` to separate the parameter names and types from the function’s return type.
//:
func greet(person: String, day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet(person: "Bob", day: "Tuesday")

//: By default, functions use their parameter names as labels for their arguments. Write a custom argument label before the parameter name, or write `_` to use no argument label.
//:
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet("John", on: "Wednesday")


//: Use a tuple to make a compound value—for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.
//:
func calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) {
    var min = scores[0]
    var max = scores[0]
    var sum = 0
    
    for score in scores {
        if score > max {
            max = score
        } else if score < min {
            min = score
        }
        sum += score
    }
    
    return (min, max, sum)
}
let statistics = calculateStatistics(scores: [5, 3, 100, 3, 9])
print(statistics.sum)
print(statistics.2)

//: Functions can be nested. Nested functions have access to variables that were declared in the outer function. You can use nested functions to organize the code in a function that is long or complex.
//:
func returnFifteen() -> Int {
    var y = 10
    func add() {
        y += 5
    }
    add()
    return y
}
returnFifteen()

//: Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.
//:
func makeIncrementer() -> ((Int) -> Int) {
    func addOne(number: Int) -> Int {
        return 1 + number
    }
    return addOne
}
var increment = makeIncrementer()
increment(7)

//: A function can take another function as one of its arguments.
//:
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -> Bool) -> Bool {
    for item in list {
        if condition(item) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
func lessThanTen(number: Int) -> Bool {
    return number < 10
}
var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)

//: - Experiment:
//: Write three functions of your choice - one with a custom argument label, one using the parameter name as the argument label, and one with no argument label. One of them must take a function as a parameter, and one must return a function.
//Experiment 1


//: Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it is executed—you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). Use `in` to separate the arguments and return type from the body.
//:
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in
    let result = 3 * number
    return result
})


//: You have several options for writing closures more concisely. When a closure’s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both. Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.
//:
let mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })
print(mappedNumbers)

//: You can refer to parameters by number instead of by name—this approach is especially useful in very short closures. A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.
//:
let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { $0 > $1 }

print(sortedNumbers)
//: You can also use Swift's ternary operator to make conditionals more compact. The format is `condition ? returnIfTrue : returnIfFalse`

let threes = numbers.map({ number in number == 3 ? 3 : 0})

//: - Experiment:
//: Using the `map` fucntion, write a closure to return an array with all the odd numbers in `newNumbers` multiplied by two. Do it without using any parentheses.
//:
var newNumbers = [3, 15, 40, 2, 9, 24, 77, 0]
let nums = newNumbers.map({ number in number % 2 == 1 ? number * 2 : number})
//: ## Objects and Classes
//:
//: Use `class` followed by the class’s name to create a class. A property declaration in a class is written the same way as a constant or variable declaration, except that it is in the context of a class. Likewise, method and function declarations are written the same way.
//:
class Shape {
    let newProperty = "new property"
    var numberOfSides = 0
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
    func checkLine() -> Bool {
        return numberOfSides == 1
    }
}

//: - Experiment:
//: Add a constant property to Shape with `let`, and add another method checkLine that returns true of the shape is a line.
//:
//: Create an instance of a class by putting parentheses after the class name. Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance.
//:
var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()
//: This version of the `Shape` class is missing something important: an initializer to set up the class when an instance is created. Use `init` to create one.
//:
class NamedShape {
    var numberOfSides: Int = 0
    var name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
}

//: Notice how `self` is used to distinguish the `name` property from the `name` argument to the initializer. The arguments to the initializer are passed like a function call when you create an instance of the class. Every property needs a value assigned—either in its declaration (as with `numberOfSides`) or in the initializer (as with `name`).
//:
//: Use `deinit` to create a deinitializer if you need to perform some cleanup before the object is deallocated.
//:
//: Subclasses include their superclass name after their class name, separated by a colon.
//:
//: Methods on a subclass that override the superclass’s implementation are marked with `override`—overriding a method by accident, without `override`, is detected by the compiler as an error. The compiler also detects methods with `override` that don’t actually override any method in the superclass.
//:
class Square: NamedShape {
    var sideLength: Double
    
    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
        self.sideLength = sideLength
        super.init(name: name)
        numberOfSides = 4
    }
    
    func area() -> Double {
        return sideLength * sideLength
    }
    
    override func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A square with sides of length \(sideLength)."
    }
}
let test = Square(sideLength: 5.2, name: "my test square")
test.area()
test.simpleDescription()

//: - Experiment:
//: Make another subclass of `NamedShape` called `Circle` that takes a radius and a name as arguments to its initializer. Implement an `area()` and a `simpleDescription()` method on the `Circle` class.
//:
//Experiment 4


//: In addition to simple properties that are stored, properties can have a getter and a setter.
//:
class EquilateralTriangle: NamedShape {
    var sideLength: Double = 0.0
    
    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
        self.sideLength = sideLength
        super.init(name: name)
        numberOfSides = 3
    }
    
    var perimeter: Double {
        get {
            return 3.0 * sideLength
        }
        set {
            sideLength = newValue / 3.0
        }
    }
    
    override func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "An equilateral triangle with sides of length \(sideLength)."
    }
}
var triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: 3.1, name: "a triangle")
print(triangle.perimeter)
triangle.perimeter = 9.9
print(triangle.sideLength)

//: In the setter for `perimeter`, the new value has the implicit name `newValue`. You can provide an explicit name in parentheses after `set`.
//:
//: Notice that the initializer for the `EquilateralTriangle` class has three different steps:
//:
//: 1. Setting the value of properties that the subclass declares.
//:
//: 1. Calling the superclass’s initializer.
//:
//: 1. Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. Any additional setup work that uses methods, getters, or setters can also be done at this point.
//:
//: If you don’t need to compute the property but still need to provide code that is run before and after setting a new value, use `willSet` and `didSet`. The code you provide is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer. For example, the class below ensures that the side length of its triangle is always the same as the side length of its square.
//:
class TriangleAndSquare {
    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle {
        willSet {
            square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
        }
    }
    var square: Square {
        willSet {
            triangle.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
        }
    }
    init(size: Double, name: String) {
        square = Square(sideLength: size, name: name)
        triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: size, name: name)
    }
}
var triangleAndSquare = TriangleAndSquare(size: 10, name: "another test shape")
print(triangleAndSquare.square.sideLength)
print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)
triangleAndSquare.square = Square(sideLength: 50, name: "larger square")
print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)

//: When working with optional values, you can write `?` before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the `?` is `nil`, everything after the `?` is ignored and the value of the whole expression is `nil`. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and everything after the `?` acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value.
//:
let optionalSquare: Square? = Square(sideLength: 2.5, name: "optional square")
let sideLength = optionalSquare?.sideLength

//: ## Enumerations and Structures
//:
//: Use `enum` to create an enumeration. Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them.
//:
enum Rank: Int {
    case ace = 1
    case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
    case jack, queen, king
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .ace:
            return "ace"
        case .jack:
            return "jack"
        case .queen:
            return "queen"
        case .king:
            return "king"
        default:
            return String(self.rawValue)
        }
    }
}

let ace = Rank.ace
let aceRawValue = ace.rawValue

//: - Experiment:
//: Write a function that checks if two `Rank` values have the same raw value.
//:
//Experiment #5


//: By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero and incrementing by one each time, but you can change this behavior by explicitly specifying values. In the example above, `Ace` is explicitly given a raw value of `1`, and the rest of the raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use the `rawValue` property to access the raw value of an enumeration case.
//:
//: Use the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer to make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration case matching the raw value or `nil` if there is no matching `Rank`.
//:
if let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) {
    let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()
}

//: The case values of an enumeration are actual values, not just another way of writing their raw values. In fact, in cases where there isn’t a meaningful raw value, you don’t have to provide one.
//:
enum Suit {
    case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .spades:
            return "spades"
        case .hearts:
            return "hearts"
        case .diamonds:
            return "diamonds"
        case .clubs:
            return "clubs"
        }
    }
}
let hearts = Suit.hearts
let heartsDescription = hearts.simpleDescription()

//: - Experiment:
//: Add a `color()` method to `Suit` that returns “black” for spades and clubs, and returns “red” for hearts and diamonds.
//:
//: Use `struct` to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.
//:
struct Card {
    var rank: Rank
    var suit: Suit
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "The \(rank.simpleDescription()) of \(suit.simpleDescription())"
    }
}
let threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)
let threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()

//: ## Protocols and Extensions
//:
//: Use `protocol` to declare a protocol.
//:
protocol ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String { get }
    func adjust()
}

//: Classes, enumerations, and structs can all adopt protocols.
//:
class SimpleClass: ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String = "A very simple class."
    var anotherProperty: Int = 69105
    func adjust() {
        simpleDescription += "  Now 100% adjusted."
    }
}
var a = SimpleClass()
a.adjust()
let aDescription = a.simpleDescription

//: - Experiment:
//: Add another requirement to `ExampleProtocol`. What changes do you need to make to `SimpleClass` and `SimpleStructure` so that they still conform to the protocol?
//:
//: Use `extension` to add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties. You can use an extension to add protocol conformance to a type that is declared elsewhere, or even to a type that you imported from a library or framework.
//:
extension SimpleClass {
    func newDescription() -> String {
        return "An extended class"
    }
}


//: - Experiment:
//: Write an extension for the `Double` type that adds an `absoluteValue` property.
